# Accent Color Synchronizer
Windows 10 introduced a system-wide accent color system that automatically applies
a custom color to many part of the UI including third-party apps. Unfortunately, only
apps made for the Universal Windows Platform benefit from this feature and desktop apps
are stuck with the same color scheme since Vista.

Accent Color Synchronizer is a portable program for Windows 10 that applies your accent color to 
desktop apps by updating *System Colors* based on your accent color.
